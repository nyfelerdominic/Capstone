# Parking Utilization and Optimization

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that leverages the capabilities of computer vision to detect vehicles and recognize license plate numbers. This will enhance the monitoring of parking space utilization and ensure adherence to parking policies. The final outcome of this project is a proof-of-concept that serves as a model for a full scale implementation. On this project, we will not be implementing any hardware on the client's main campus.
